ONLY COPY THE LOADSTRING.

-- RAYXV002 | MAIN SCRIPT | DAHOOD | #1
loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/urmomugly/lua-project/main/Script%26/RAYXV001'))()

IF RAYX DOESN'T EXECUTE FOR YOU THAT MEANS 2 THING
1. YOUR EXPLOIT IS NOT SUPPORTED.
2. YOUR WIFI IS SLOW SO WAIT FOR THE SCRIPT TO LOAD.
